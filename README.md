**Frequency of words**.       
This project takes a small text file, parses and plots the most frequent words present in the file. There are two documents uploaded for this project:
1. word.freq.code.pdf.      
2. word.freq.data.txt.      
word.freq.code.pdf has the result in a pdf format. word.freq.data.txt has the raw data.         

**Reverse order**.         
This project deals with 
     1) Taking a string and reversing the order
     2) Taking a csv file, selecting particular rows, and saving the output to a folder in the working directory
'reverse_order.m' is the script and 'data.csv' is the dataset.
